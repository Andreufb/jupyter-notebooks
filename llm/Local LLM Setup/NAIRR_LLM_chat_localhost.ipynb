    "### What is an LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the data it's been trained on. By adding a vast amount of text from different sources and context's (web, books, papers, among others) LLM's are capable to identify the patterns of the human language under different contexts and provide responses to complex questions.  Popular LLM's today include GPT-4 (ChatGPT), LlaMA-2, Claude-2, among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLM's posses a huge potential in both research and education, given their capability to quickly process and summarize a vast amount of information. LLM's can bee seen as a powerful tool to accelerate learning, facilitate the sharing of knowledge, process and generate big amounts of data, generate new hypothesis questions, among other uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ClimateGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo, we are using the [ClimateGPT](https://climategpt.ai/) model. Climate GPT was launched in January 2024, and it represents one of the first LLM's fine-tuned on climate research chorpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a fine tuned version of META's LlaMA-2, and it has been designed to accelerate research aimed to face the current climate crisis, targeting researcers, policymakers and educators as primary users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands on\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start using LLM as a service. First, we will make some questions to the vanilla ClimateGPT to see its capabilities. Then, we will extend the chorpus of the model by adding a new document. We expect the model to be able to answer questions based on the new document."
